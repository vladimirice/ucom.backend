# Entity images

Estimated time to implement - 2h per entity.

To add image(s) to any entity, please consider using a `entity_images` architectural feature.

**The steps to do this:**
* Create a new column using a migration - [example](../../migrations_knex_monolith/20190405081637-alter-comments-add-entity-images.js).
* *Optional:* add a new column to an appropriate ORM model.
* Extend an existing model interface by `ModelWithEntityImages.` The interface is [here](../../lib/entity-images/interfaces/model-interfaces.ts).
* Make it possible to add a `entity_images` field to the model during a creation process via [entity images input service](../../lib/entity-images/service/entity-image-input-service.ts).
* Make it possible to update a `entity_images` field (not yet implemented, TODO).
* Write the autotests - [example](../../test/integration/comments/comments-entity-images.test.ts).
* Add the `entity_images` field to the GraphQL client library and to the GraphQL backend application server.
* If there are any legacy fields to hold images then please don't forget to migrate existing images from these fields to the new field.

**Related code conventions:**
* Any other existing methods to store entity-related images are deprecated. Any new methods to store images are forbidden.
* Do not use a column name inside the code as a plain string. Use this method:
```
EntityImagesModelProvider.entityImagesColumn()
```
* Keep in mind that a concrete `entity_images` JSON structure is up to the client application.
It is not required to validate it somehow.
* To clear an existing `entity_images` value, please send empty object `{}.`
