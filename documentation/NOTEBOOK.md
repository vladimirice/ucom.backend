# NOTEBOOK

Goal - just to save workflow before implementation.

---- Worker - Change user status to pending ----


Step 2: Users-tokens and airdrop state:
fetch status from external_data, not hardcoded NEW

Step 3:
Add new worker to pm2 env

----------- Activity data provider -------------

workflow

* Fetch all blocks data one by one and save inside mock provider
* Fetch also `random blocks` - initcalc and a couple of social transaction ones

-------------

ask for last block or blocks (id > last memorized id) - 0.5

* Get last block number
SELECT block_number FROM ${TABLE_NAME} ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;

* Get last_irreversible_block_number
SELECT last_state.irrblocknum FROM mongoDb.last_state

* Get new blocks:
SELECT * FROM mongoDb where blocknum > ${last_block_number} and blocknum > ${last_state.last_irreversible_block_number}

for (const block of blocks) {
check
* should be irreversible = true
* top level structure, fields existence
** blocknum
** blockid
** trxid
** account
** irreversible
** actions
*** act_data inside
** blocktime

* Check every action basic structure
** act_data - array

** push it to chain of responsibility
}

transfer and link to next checker inside

transfer checks data -
if it is ok then generate backend-parsed data and return it
=> special Dto to save to tr_traces
else - move to next

if nothing - special processor parse it as `undetermined` (special key) and put into db

Next step:
* Just receive data from chain processor and save it to db

chain of responsibility - check conditions for every transaction processing block - 1h
** If match then process it - call related processor => Save processed data to postgres (same structure but new table) - 0.5h
Autotests, patterns implementations - 1.5h

insert {
    tr_type - determined by backend
    tr_processed_data - raw data parsed by backend
    memo - from action_traces
    tr_id - raw data - first level
    external_id - ? not required any more. Deprecated one
    account_name_from - raw data
    account_name_to - raw data
    raw_tr_data - save raw tr trace from mongodb. Will be removed in the future
}

add new columns
block_number -> blocknum
block_id -> blockid
tr_id -> trxid


add column block id to new table

===================

Before staging deployment:
* Create connection inside staging config

Before production deployment:
* Create connection inside staging config

Before activity table renaming:
* add filter for activity - WHERE tr_type != `${UNDETERMINED_TYPE}`
* check manually all transactions - it is not required to provide integration autotests

Extra:
* Registration
* Vote for calculators
* Unstake resources as result (delayed action)
